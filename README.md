# Building

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates an exe in `./dist`

# Install

Just run it the exe. Either build it or use the release page.

# Auto start

Add a shortcut brightness to the exe into the auto start folder. You can find it by executing `shell:startup` in the run command window. Mine looks like this

```
C:\Users\my-name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
